# Ethiopian Medical Telegram Data Pipeline

This project implements a complete, production-style data pipeline for analyzing Ethiopian medical Telegram channels. The pipeline scrapes messages and images, transforms raw data into a structured data warehouse, enriches images using computer vision, exposes analytics through a REST API, and orchestrates the entire workflow using Dagster.

## What This Project Does

The pipeline performs five tightly integrated tasks:

• Scrapes messages and images from public Ethiopian medical Telegram channels  
• Stores raw data in a structured data lake (JSON + images)  
• Transforms raw data into a clean PostgreSQL data warehouse using dbt  
• Enriches image data using YOLO object detection  
• Exposes analytical insights via a FastAPI service  
• Automates everything using Dagster orchestration  

This ensures the data is reliable, testable, observable, and production-ready.

## Data Sources

Public Telegram channels related to Ethiopian medical businesses, including:

- Chemed  
- Lobelia Cosmetics  
- Tikvah Pharma  
- Additional channels from https://et.tgstat.com/medicine  

## Pipeline Architecture

Telegram → Raw Data Lake → PostgreSQL (Raw) → dbt Staging → dbt Star Schema → YOLO Image Enrichment → Analytical API (FastAPI) → Orchestrated with Dagster

## Task Summary

### Task 1 – Data Scraping & Collection

- Extract message ID, date, text, views, forwards, and media info  
- Download images per channel and message  
- Store raw data as JSON partitioned by date and channel  
- Log scraping activity and errors  

### Task 2 – Data Modeling & Transformation

- Load raw JSON into PostgreSQL (`raw.telegram_messages`)  
- Clean and standardize data using dbt staging models  
- Build a star schema:
  - `dim_channels`
  - `dim_dates`
  - `fct_messages`
- Enforce data quality with dbt tests  
- Generate dbt documentation  

### Task 3 – Image Enrichment (YOLO)

- Run YOLOv8 object detection on scraped images  
- Detect objects and confidence scores  
- Classify images as:
  - promotional
  - product_display
  - lifestyle
  - other
- Store results in `fct_image_detections`  

### Task 4 – Analytical API

FastAPI exposes warehouse insights through REST endpoints:

- Top mentioned products  
- Channel activity trends  
- Keyword-based message search  
- Visual content statistics  

Includes Pydantic validation and OpenAPI documentation.

### Task 5 – Pipeline Orchestration

- Dagster coordinates the entire workflow  
- Ensures correct execution order  
- Supports scheduling, logging, monitoring, and failure alerts  

## How to Run

```bash
# Scrape Telegram data
python src/scraper.py
